## About The Project

During the Covid-19 pandemic many physical stores had to close to comply with social distancing orders and the world has seen a rapid shift to Ecommerce. Most of the small businesses had no time or money to build their own Ecommerce. Given those circunstances we build Meu carrinho, a digital shopping cart made to make it easier for small shops to sell online and on social media and to manage their small businesses.
